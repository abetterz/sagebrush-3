                            The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the greatest foreign threat to our country and is quickly moving to become the world's most influential economic and militaristic superpower. The CCP wants to exclude the United States from the Western Pacific and Asia. It has infiltrated key American industries and institutions, especially academia and technology. Our organization seeks to eliminate China's influence on American domestic industry, innovation, research, and reverse the expansion of its power around the globe.
