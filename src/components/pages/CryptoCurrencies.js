                            Crypto currencies represent a vision for a return to sound money. Since the abandonment of the gold standard and creation of the modern Federal Reserve in 1971, the US economy has suffered at times from inflation, stagflation, wide scale bank failures, manipulated interest rates, and high budget and trade deficits, all of which can be traced in part to weakening of the dollar.
                            A dollar today is worth just about one-fifth of its 1971 ancestorâ€”a hefty stealth tax that afflicts the rich and poor alike. While some cryptos are volatile and still immature, the field offers the potential of a market-based alternative to government currencies. Crypto currencies exist as a free, privatized currency that is not subject to the manipulation of the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department or other agencies. Our policy is to ensure that crypto currencies remain unregulated and under the sole control of the people who develop, invest, and place value in them.
