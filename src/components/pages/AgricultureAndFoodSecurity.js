                        <p>
                            Conglomerates and foreign investors have too much control over Americaâ€™s food. During the
                            height of the 2020 Covid-19 economic shutdown, many big food processors sent home their
                            employees, preventing ranchers from getting their products to stores. Had ranchers been given
                            local options to process their meat and produce, many local meat packing plants and
                            processors could have enabled ranchers and farmers to keep grocery store shelves full and to
                            make a living themselves. Our organization will seek to implement policy changes that will allow
                            food to be locally processed and locally sold in order to help ranchers and farmers and secure
                            the food supply
