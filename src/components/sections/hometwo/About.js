                                    America was built by settlers, cowboys, laborers, and businessmen. Citizens who were ambitious and worked towards prosperity and security. The United States was once the irrefutable standard-bearer of liberty for all mankind.

We are committed to gutting incompetent and corrupt leaders from the political process and supporting individuals who will do what is necessary to save America.
